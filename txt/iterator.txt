"The template can be specialized for user-defined iterators so that the information about the iterator can be retrieved even if the type does not provide the usual typedefs."

Je sais pas si c'est Ã  faire mais surement ?
ATTENTION :
"If Iter does not have pointer, but has all other four member types, then the member types are declared as follows:"


"Otherwise, if Iter satisfies the exposition-only concept __LegacyInputIterator, the member types are declared as follows:"

Membres types :
template <Class Iter>
Doit etre inclu sous forme Iter::type ?
